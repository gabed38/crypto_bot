# Crypto Trading Bot

An LLM-powered crypto trading bot that uses Claude to analyze markets and recommend trades, with fully mechanical position management. Built as a paper-trading POC — all trades are written to file, nothing is executed on an exchange.

**Core strategy:** Volatile swing trading — buy dips of 5–30% on mid/small-cap coins and ride the mean-reversion bounce, targeting 5–10% gains in hours to days.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd crypto_bot
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Build coin behavioral profiles (run once, then weekly)
python scripts/build_coin_profiles.py

# Run the bot
python scripts/intraday_trader.py

# Launch the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## How It Works

The bot runs a single script (`scripts/intraday_trader.py`) that executes three phases in sequence. It is designed to run every **4 hours** via cron.

### Phase 1 — Position Management (Fully Mechanical)

Checks every open position using six deterministic price-based rules — **no LLM involved**. Rules are checked in priority order; the first rule that fires closes the position.

1. **Load open positions** from `data/positions/open_positions.json`
2. **Batch fetch current prices** from CoinGecko for all held coins
3. **Update trailing high-water marks** — track the highest observed price per position
4. **Apply exit rules in order:**

   | Rule | Trigger | Close Type |
   |------|---------|------------|
   | Stop-loss | Down ≥ `adaptive_stop_pct` from entry | `STOP_LOSS` |
   | Trailing stop | Down ≥ `adaptive_stop_pct` from high-water mark (once in profit) | `TRAILING_STOP` |
   | Take-profit | Gain ≥ `target_pct` | `TAKE_PROFIT` |
   | Profit protection | Peak gain ≥ 5%, current gain ≤ 35% of peak (e.g. peak +8% → close at +2.8%) | `PROFIT_PROTECTION` |
   | Mid-horizon stale exit | Past 50% of `time_horizon` with P&L < +0.5% — thesis not materialising | `STALE_POSITION` |
   | Time horizon expired | Held past full `time_horizon` | `TIME_EXPIRED` |

5. **Execute closes** — closed positions are appended to `data/positions/resolved_trades.jsonl`
6. **Update open positions** — surviving positions saved back with updated prices and P&L

#### Vol-adaptive stops

Stop-loss percentages are not flat — they're computed per coin from 14-day daily volatility:

```
adaptive_stop_pct = max(min(daily_vol_pct × 3, 25.0), 10.0)
```

| Coin type | Daily vol | Adaptive stop |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| BTC/ETH | ~2%/day | 10% (floor) |
| Typical alt | ~4%/day | 12% |
| High-vol alt | ~7%/day | 21% |
| Extreme alt | ≥10%/day | 25% (cap) |

This prevents stops from firing on normal noise for volatile coins, while giving low-vol coins a tighter leash.

### Phase 2 — New Trade Discovery

Finds new dip-buy candidates using a multi-stage funnel before the LLM ever sees the data.

#### Drawdown circuit breaker

Before fetching any data, the bot checks unrealised portfolio P&L:
- **≥ -15% drawdown** → warn, continue with note injected into prompt
- **≥ -25% drawdown** → halt, Phase 2 exits immediately

#### Regime-adaptive rules

After fetching the Fear & Greed Index, the bot determines the current **market regime** and adjusts trading parameters. All regimes allow trading across the full 500-coin universe — there are no rank caps.

| Regime | F&G | Min conviction | Max open | L1 coins (BTC/ETH/SOL/TRX) |
|--------|-----|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Extreme Fear | ≤ 20 | 0.68 | 15 | excluded |
| Fear | 21–40 | 0.68 | 18 | excluded |
| Neutral | 41–60 | 0.72 | 20 | allowed |
| Greed | 61–80 | 0.75 | 20 | allowed |
| Extreme Greed | > 80 | blocked | — | — |

L1 large-caps are excluded in Fear/Extreme Fear because the strategy's edge is in mid/small-cap mean-reversion. Historical data shows 25% win rate on L1 entries in fear regimes.

#### 7-step pipeline

1. **Fetch market data** from CoinGecko (free API, no key required):
   - Top **500 coins** by market cap with price, 1h/24h/7d change, volume
   - Trending coins
   - Fear & Greed Index (from alternative.me)

2. **Quantitative pre-screen** — scores and filters all 500 coins, returning the top 25 candidates. Hard filters run first; scoring runs after.

   **Hard filters (applied before scoring):**
   - Stablecoins and wrapped/pegged tokens (by ID list and symbol pattern)
   - Already-held coins
   - Coins already pumped past the exhaustion threshold (can't buy the top of a pump):
     - Extreme Fear: >12% in 24h
     - Fear: >18% in 24h
     - Neutral+: >30% in 24h
   - Volume below $10M 24h floor

   **Scoring factors:**

   | Factor | Range | Signal |
   |--------|-------|--------|
   | Momentum (1h×0.2 + 24h×0.5 + 7d×0.3) | ±10 pts | Price trend strength |
   | Volume spike (vol / market cap) | 0–5 pts | Unusual trading activity |
   | Relative strength vs BTC | ±5 pts | Outperforming Bitcoin |
   | Trending on CoinGecko | +3 pts | Community interest |
   | **Dip-buy bonus** (down 4–30% in 24h with volume) | up to +6 pts | Mean-reversion setup |
   | Exhaustion soft penalty (pumped but under hard-filter threshold) | up to -6 pts | Likely priced in |
   | Regime history bonus (≥65% win rate + avg 7d ≥2% in current F&G band) | +2.0 pts | Strong historical edge |
   | Regime history good (+55% win rate) | +0.75 pts | Decent historical edge |
   | Regime history penalty (≤30% win rate) | -1.5 pts | Historically poor regime |
   | Fear & Greed rank penalty (small cap in fear market) | -2 pts | Risk adjustment |

3. **Volatility + RSI enrichment** — for each of the top 25 candidates, two API calls are made:

   - **14-day price history** → computes `daily_vol_pct`, vol-adaptive stop, `stop_multiple`
   - **24h hourly chart** → computes **intraday RSI(14)** and 4h momentum

   After enrichment, two additional filters and scoring adjustments apply:

   - **RSI hard filter (dip candidates only):** if `change_24h ≤ -4%` AND `RSI > 55`, the coin is rejected — the dip has already bounced, it's too late to enter
   - **RSI scoring:**
     - RSI < 30 (deeply oversold): **+4 pts**
     - RSI 30–40 (oversold): **+2 pts**
     - RSI > 65 (overbought): **-2 pts**

   Coins are also rejected if `adaptive_stop_pct / daily_vol_pct < 1.5` (stop fires on normal noise).

4. **Fetch and filter news** — up to 60 articles from 10 RSS feeds, filtered to only articles mentioning shortlisted coins.

5. **Build LLM prompt** combining:
   - Pre-screened candidates table with score, vol, adaptive stop, **RSI**, 4h momentum, and signals
   - Filtered news headlines and summaries
   - Portfolio state (open positions, unrealised P&L, available slots)
   - **Coin behavioral profiles** — 90-day historical stats per coin
   - Recent lessons from `data/performance/lessons.json`

6. **Claude analysis** — returns trade recommendations as JSON, each with:
   - `coin_id`, `symbol`, `coin_name`
   - `conviction` — 0.0 to 1.0 confidence score
   - `reasoning` and `risks`
   - `time_horizon` — expected hold period. Hard cap: **2d maximum**. Default is 1d for dip bounces, 2d for catalyst plays. (3d/7d holds went 0-for-4 historically.)
   - `target_pct` — typically 5–8% for dip bounces
   - `stop_loss_pct`

   Entry price sanity check: if Claude's suggested price deviates >2% from CoinGecko's live price, the trade is rejected. Entry price is always overwritten with the actual live price.

7. **Risk filters and execution**:
   - Drop trades below regime's minimum conviction threshold
   - Sector concentration cap (max 4 positions per sector)
   - Dynamic daily loss check: `max(committed_capital × 25%, $5 floor)`
   - Write approved trades to `data/trades/trades_YYYYMMDD.jsonl` and `open_positions.json`

### Phase 3 — Post-Trade Analysis (Continuous Learning)

If any positions were closed in Phase 1, the bot runs a learning cycle.

1. **Send closed trades + current positions** to Claude for review
2. **Claude extracts**: what worked, what didn't, specific actionable lessons
3. **Save lessons** to `data/performance/lessons.json`
4. **Next run** — Phase 2 injects recent lessons into the prompt

---

## Coin Behavioral Profiles

The profile pipeline (`scripts/build_coin_profiles.py`) fetches 90-day price history for up to 500 coins and computes a behavioral fingerprint for each. Profiles are saved to `data/coin_profiles/profiles.json` and injected into every Phase 2 LLM prompt.

### What's computed per coin

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `daily_vol_pct` | Std dev of daily log returns — how noisy is this coin? |
| `btc_corr` | Pearson correlation with BTC daily returns |
| `btc_beta` | Leverage multiple vs BTC (1.4x = amplifies BTC moves by 40%) |
| `momentum_persistence` | Lag-1 autocorrelation — positive = trending, negative = mean-reverting |
| `worst_drawdown_pct` | Worst peak-to-trough loss over 90 days |
| `regime_returns` | Avg 7-day forward return + win rate, grouped by F&G band at entry |

### Running the profile builder

```bash
# Full run — top 500 coins, 90-day history (~40 min due to rate limits)
python scripts/build_coin_profiles.py

# Smaller run for testing
python scripts/build_coin_profiles.py --coins 50 --days 30

# Update specific coins only
python scripts/build_coin_profiles.py --coin-ids bitcoin,ethereum,solana
```

Run this **weekly** to keep profiles current. Add to crontab:
```
0 6 * * 1 cd /Users/studio/Code/crypto_bot && venv/bin/python scripts/build_coin_profiles.py >> logs/intraday_cron.log 2>&1
```

## Risk Management

| Control | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| Vol-adaptive stop-loss | Per-coin: `max(min(daily_vol × 3, 25%), 10%)` — stamped at entry |
| Trailing stop | Once in profit, close if price falls `adaptive_stop_pct` below high-water mark |
| Take-profit | Close when gain reaches `target_pct` |
| Profit protection | Peak gain ≥5%, current gain ≤35% of peak (e.g. peak +8% → close at +2.8%) |
| Mid-horizon stale exit | Past 50% of time horizon with P&L < +0.5% → cut early, thesis not materialising |
| Time horizon | Close positions held past their full intended duration |
| Exhaustion hard filter | Reject coins already pumped >12/18/30% in 24h (regime-dependent) |
| RSI hard filter | Reject dip candidates (down >4%) if RSI >55 (bounce already done) |
| Dynamic daily loss limit | `max(open_positions × $5 × 25%, $5)` |
| Drawdown warning | Unrealised loss ≥ -15% → note in LLM prompt |
| Drawdown halt | Unrealised loss ≥ -25% → block all new trades |
| Volatility filter | Reject coins where adaptive stop fires within 1.5 daily moves |
| Entry price sanity | Reject if LLM price deviates >2% from live CoinGecko price |
| Conviction floor | Regime-adaptive: 0.68 (Fear) → 0.75 (Greed) |
| Sector concentration | Max 4 positions per sector |

## Data Sources

All free, no API keys required (except Anthropic for the LLM):

| Source | What It Provides | Rate Limits |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| CoinGecko API | Top 500 coins, prices, 1h/24h/7d change, volume, trending, 90-day history, 24h hourly OHLCV | ~30 req/min |
| Alternative.me | Fear & Greed Index (0–100) | Unlimited |
| 10 RSS feeds | Crypto news (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Decrypt, The Block, BeInCrypto, Bitcoinist, NewsBTC, AMBCrypto, Bitcoin Magazine, CryptoPotato) | Unlimited |

---

## Running the Bot

```bash
# Full run (all 3 phases)
python scripts/intraday_trader.py

# Skip Phase 1 — only discover new trades
python scripts/intraday_trader.py --skip-closes

# Skip Phase 2 — only manage existing positions
python scripts/intraday_trader.py --skip-new-trades
```

### What to expect on first run

1. No open positions → Phase 1 prints "No open positions to check" and exits
2. Phase 2 determines market regime, fetches 500 coins across 2 CoinGecko pages
3. Quant screen scores ~150–200 qualifying coins, returns top 25
4. Volatility + RSI enrichment: one 14-day history call + one 24h hourly call per candidate (~90s due to rate limits)
5. LLM recommends dip-buy trades, phase applies risk filters
6. Total runtime: approximately **2–3 minutes** per run (RSI fetches add time vs old pipeline)
